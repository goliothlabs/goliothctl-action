# âœ¨ Quickstart

The fastest way to use the CLI:

```yaml
- name: Setup Golioth CLI
  uses: goliothlabs/goliothctl-action@main
  with:
    apiKey: ${{ secrets.APIKEY }}
    projectId: ${{ secrets.PROJECTID }}

- name: List devices
  run: goliothctl device list
```

The primary action only requires a Golioth API Key and Project ID. Refer to the Golioth [documentation](https://docs.golioth.io/) for to generate an API Key and retrieve a Project ID. We recommend settings these values as [repository secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions).

# Additional Actions

There are 3 additional "create" actions currently supported for devices, artifacts and releases intended to be used as steps in CI.

```yaml
- name: Checkout
  uses: actions/checkout@v4
    
- name: Use goliothctl
  uses: goliothlabs/goliothctl-action@main
  with:
    apiKey: ${{ secrets.APIKEY }}
    projectId: ${{ vars.PROJECTID }}
    deviceName: #SOME_NAME#
    deviceTag: #SOME_TAG#
    file: #SOME_FILE#
    artifactVersion: #SOME_VERSION
    releaseArtifact: #SOME_ARTIFACT#
    releaseVersion: #SOME_VERSION
    releaseTag: #SOME_TAG#
```

Each step is optional, ex. only create a release.
